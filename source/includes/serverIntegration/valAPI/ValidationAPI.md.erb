## Validation API
When previous API was called, data will be created on ShopBack with parameter and “pending” status. Therefore, we need to use this API to override data status when order has been validated.

### HTTPS Request Of Validation API

`GET https://shopback.go2cloud.org/aff_lsr`

>step 3 

```shell
#approved
curl -X GET "https://shopback.go2cloud.org/aff_lsr"\
-d {"offer_id":"2118",\
    "aff_id":"1152",\
    "adv_sub":"A0149",\
    "amount":70,\
    "status":"approved",\
    "security_token":"c2a32524880"}

#rejected
curl -X GET "https://shopback.go2cloud.org/aff_lsr"\
-d {"offer_id":"2118",\
    "aff_id":"1152",\
    "adv_sub":"A0188",\
    "amount":130,\
    "status":"rejected",\
    "security_token":"c2a32524880"}
```

```javascript
// approved
var param = {"aff_id":"1152", "adv_sub":"A0149",
            "amount":70, "status":"approved",
            "security_token":"c2a32524880"};
// rejected
var param = {"aff_id":"1152", "adv_sub":"A0188",
            "amount":130, "status":"rejected",
            "security_token":"c2a32524880"};
// send request
var XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest").XMLHttpRequest;
var requests = new XMLHttpRequest();
var src = "https://shopback.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2118";
var keys = Object.keys(param);
for(var i in keys)
    src += '&' + keys[i] + '=' + param[keys[i]];
requests.open('GET', src, false);
requests.send();
var returnValue = requests.responseText;
```

```python
import requests

# approved
params = {
    "offer_id":"2118", "aff_id":"1152", "adv_sub":"A0149",
    "amount":70, "status":"approved",
    "security_token":"c2a32524880"
}
# rejected
params = {
    "offer_id":"2118", "aff_id":"1152", "adv_sub":"A0188",
    "amount":130, "status":"rejected",
    "security_token":"c2a32524880"
}
# send request
src = "https://shopback.go2cloud.org/aff_c"
r = requests.get(src, params = params)
```
